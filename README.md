#Project Titile: Automate demo fintech API by using Postman and Newman
##Project Summary: In this project, I have created a postman collection based for a demo fintech web application called "dmoney" to cover the following scenario:
--Admin creates an agent and random 2 customers. Admin email: admin@roadtocareer.net/ Pass: 1234--
--Deposit some money from SYSTEM account to the agent. System account: SYSTEM (range 10 tk to 10000 tk)--
--Agent deposit to any of 1 customer--
--Check agent balance--
--Then withdraw any amount by the customer from the agent (range 10 tk to 10000 tk)--
--Then the customer checks balance--
--Then send money to the other customer--
--Then from the another customer payment to any merchant (create a merchant account)--
--Then the second customer will check both balance and statement--
--Then the merchant will check his own balance--
